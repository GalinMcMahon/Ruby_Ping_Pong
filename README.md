## Description

We created a ruby program to check and validate few Specifications in a array of numbers and push strings according to the conditions.

## Specifications

| Behaviour | Input | Output |
|-----------|-------|--------|
|The program lets the user enter a number and pushes into an empty array   | i.e.: 4| [1,2,3,4]|
|The program lets the user enter a number and check if the number is divisible by 3 and push a string "ping" in the place of the number  | i.e.: 6 |[1,2,"ping",4,5,"ping"]|
|The program lets the user enter a number and check if the number is divisible by 5 and push a string "pong" in the place of the number  | i.e: 5 |[1,2,"ping",4,"pong","ping"]|
|The program lets the user enter a number and check if the number is divisible by 15 and push a string "ping-pong" in the place of the number | i.e: 15 |[1,2.....14,"ping-pong"]|
